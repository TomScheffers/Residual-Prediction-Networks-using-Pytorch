# Residual prediction networks using Pytorch
The residual prediction network is an effort to improve the classification performance of neural networks.
This repo is used for testing the newly proposed hypothesis on the CIFAR10/100 datasets, however the class implementing the residual prediction network can be used as a drop-in replacement for fully connected layers. It can be found in the models folder.
